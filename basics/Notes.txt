****** Python Collections (Arrays)***********

There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

 	1.   List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
	2.    Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
	3.    Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
	4.    Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

		*Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.

		**As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
